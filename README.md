## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

Day One: Added markup and got started with the styling page by setting my color variables.

Day Two: Finished styling for desktop page. Added Javascript for form validation. Spent a long time figuring out how to get my code to read the value of the user input. It seems to have boiled down to syntax errors. I got the logic right, just needed to spell everything out correctly. Will need to add more parameters to the form validation but it is very nice to have the framework down.

Days Three and Four: Finished tablet and mobile versions. Didn't run into any significant hangups.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

- Form styling
- Using a placeholder attribute within a textbox
- The focus psuedo selector
- How to get the value of user input text

Surprised by how intuitive the Javascript felt. I always feel as if there's a better, more "advanced" route or method but I'm proud that I am able to figure things out using what I know. I feel that puts me in a good place to build upon current knowledge.

### Continued development

Of course I will continue to learn and practice more Javascript concepts. For this specific project. I could have added more parameters for the form verification, e.g. must contain ".com", ".edu", or ".net". However with the logic-flow I created, the code would never get to the success condition. I would need some way for it to check for at least one of them, but not stop running the function when it doesn't see one of the endings.
